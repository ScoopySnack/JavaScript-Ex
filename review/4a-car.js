console.log(car.brand)  // Toyota, Whith "." we can access the value of the key "brand" in the object "car"

//In JavaScript ';' is optional, but it is a good practice to use it.

//Syntax of a JavaScript object is similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) syntax. It is a collection of key-value pairs. The key is always a string, but the value can be any valid JavaScript data type, such as a string, number, boolean, array, or another object. ":" is used to separate the key and value, and "," is used to separate the key-value pairs.

//Technically an object is a reference type, so when we assign an object to a variable, the variable stores a reference to the object in memory, not the object itself. This means that if we assign an object to another variable, both variables will reference the same object in memory. If we change a property of the object using one variable, the change will be reflected when accessing the object using the other variable.

//Undifined is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. It is the default value of variables that have not been assigned a value, and it is also returned by functions that do not explicitly return a value. It is a falsy value, which means it is considered false in Boolean contexts. It is also considered a type of "null" in JavaScript.
